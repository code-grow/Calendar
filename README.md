# Calendar
A very simple c++ calendar console program.


### IDE - Code::Blocks
The program has for this moment a bug, but I am going to fix in the near future.<br/>
When you press the option 1 it shows the right month, but not the right year.<br/>
As in the example below the year 2023, after 124, after 1776.<br/>
